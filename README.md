# FormLicense
For some (such as survival) servers, they hope that players without a white list can enjoy some unique content (such as beauty or features) of the server. If you are a server owner, you can choose formlicense to do this.
## Feature
- Simple and lightweight enough
- Most (existing functions) can be customized
- Players without a license(permission) will be in adventure mode
- Send information to players when they join
 - If you want, players will not find all traces of FormLicense in the game.(More fully display your brand)
- Plugin functions are constantly update and open-source
- If you want to prevent unlicensed players from doing anything, you can request it on the issue page.

## About Plugin
You can reprint the plugin on any minecraft website. But you must let me know (such as scoring on spigot or sending me an email:poikcue@outlook.com)
The plugin is still in the early construction stage and is constantly improving its functions. Therefore, the existing content may not meet your needs. Please forgive me. If you can, please actively communicate with me and request new functions. If you like this plugin, I would be grateful:)
