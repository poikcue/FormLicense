# FormLicense
For some (such as survival) servers, they hope that players without a white list can enjoy some unique content (such as beauty or features) of the server. If you are a server owner, you can choose formlicense to do this.
## Feature
- Simple and lightweight enough
- Most (existing functions) can be customized
- Players without a license(permission) will be in adventure mode
- *Player can't pick up and join portal* **NOW**
- Send information to players when they join
- - If you want, players will not find all traces of FormLicense in the game.(More fully display your brand)
- Plugin functions are constantly update and open-source
- If you want to prevent unlicensed players from doing anything, you can request it on the issue page.

## Apply 
Minecraft(Spigot 1.13-1.18.1)
*Only tested at 1.18 and work is perfect.But the api is Spigot-1.13,so i think it also worked between 1.13 and 1.18.*

*If you tested at 1.14-1.17, please tell me the result :D*
